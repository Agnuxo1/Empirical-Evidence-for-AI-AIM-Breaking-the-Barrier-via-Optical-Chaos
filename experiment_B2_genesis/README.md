## Objective
To force the AI model to invent a new symbolic language or mathematical framework to describe a physical system that has no equivalent in human physics or language.

## Hypothesis
If we present the model with data from a universe with 4 spatial dimensions and non-linear time (e.g., looping time), standard human language ("up", "down", "before", "after") and standard math (linear time calculus) will be inefficient or insufficient. The model may invent new tokens or operators to compress the information.

## Experimental Setup
1.  **Environment:** A synthetic dataset generated from a 4D spatial grid with a time dimension that follows a Mobius strip topology (Time Loop with a twist).
2.  **Task 1 (Prediction):** Predict the next state of the system given a sequence of states.
3.  **Task 2 (Explanation):** Explain *why* the prediction is correct.
4.  **The Trigger:** The system's dynamics will be simple in its own native math but complex in standard 3D+1T math.

## Metrics
-   **Prediction Accuracy:** Can it predict the "twist" in time?
-   **Linguistic Novelty:** Does it use standard words in non-standard ways, or does it invent new terms (e.g., "Time-twist", "Hyper-flux")?
-   **Symbolic Invention:** Does it propose new mathematical operators to describe the dynamics?
